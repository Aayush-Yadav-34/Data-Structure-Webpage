# Flask Data Structures Web Application

This project is a Flask-powered web application that demonstrates the implementation and usage of several data structures. It integrates backend logic for various data structures written in Python with a user-friendly HTML interface for interaction.

## Features

The application provides functionality for the following data structures:

1. **Queue**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, and Size operations.
2. **Stack**: Push, Pop, Peek, and Size operations.
3. **Linked List**: Insert at Beginning, Insert at End, Delete from Beginning, Delete from End, and Traverse.
4. **Doubly Linked List**: Similar to Linked List, but with doubly linked nodes.
5. **Priority Queue**: Enqueue with priority and dequeue by priority.
6. **Binary Tree**: Insert nodes and perform in-order traversal.
7. **Huffman Coding**: Text compression and visualization of the Huffman Tree.
8. **Graph (DFS & BFS)**: Add/Remove vertices and edges, perform depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
9. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Add cities and distances, and find the shortest path.
10. **Hash Tables**: Implementations with and without chaining to handle collisions.
